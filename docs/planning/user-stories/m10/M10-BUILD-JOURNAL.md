description: >
  Append-only audit trail + evidence home for M10 (trust signals — pipes for all, signals for
  few). Entry 0 seeds the milestone. Never edit a prior entry. The DoD is the SOLE status
  authority (no duplicate status board here — M8C drift lesson); this file holds the RESUME
  STATE block, the entries, and the evidence the DoD points to. A new journal file starts at
  each tier boundary (M10-BUILD-JOURNAL-T{n}.md), seeded with a 10-line resume block.

# M10 — Build Journal

## RESUME STATE (keep current — update at every checkpoint/compaction)
- **Milestone status:** seeded, not started. **Next red: DOD-CBOR-1** (the canonical-envelope
  component + cross-party hash test — first unit, everything sits on it).
- **Design notes owed before code** (PROCEDURE §6): registry format + portal key custody
  (before Tier 1); browser-extraction infra (before Tier 4 only).
- **Scope fence:** phone + email → track record (1–2) → GitHub → canary. Nothing else in v1
  (DoD M10-D1).
- **Repos:** cello-portal (center of gravity; no deploy pipeline — runs local/dev),
  trustless-cello (batch deploys: one for Tier 0/1, one for Tier 3), cello-client (publish
  cascade; all tables on `agent_id`).
- **If autonomous:** arm both crons (PROCEDURE §3b) before the first unit.

## Entries (append-only)

### 2026-07-11 — Entry 0: milestone seeded (apparatus + scope fence)

**What happened.** The M10 apparatus was created after the zero-bump architecture session
(2026-07-11) folded §15 into [[M10-TRUST-SIGNAL-STORAGE-AND-CREATION]]: PROCEDURE, this journal,
[[M10-DEFINITION-OF-DONE]] (which absorbs the DECISIONS role), and [[M10-TYPE-PLAYBOOK]].
No separate SPEC — the two M10 design docs are the spec-of-record (M10-D2).

**Scope settled with Andre (M10-D1):** v1 proves the three creation paths with the minimum
signal set — internal (phone + email, the two every agent already has from M8), directory-
computed (session count + clean-close rate, via the portal background job and a new directory
read path), and external-validator (GitHub: OAuth + hardened browser-extraction instance).
The zero-bump canary (DOD-ZEROBUMP-CANARY-1) closes Tier 2 and converts the architecture's
promise into a falsifiable test. Endorsements/PSI/bonds/other providers: post-v1, tracked in
the DoD's Post-v1 section.

**Apparatus changes vs M8C (M10-D2, from the M8C post-mortem):** evidence lives HERE with the
DoD as a scoreboard (one line + entry pointer per flip); no duplicate status board in this file
(the M8C boards drifted); journal splits per tier; decisions live in the DoD.

**Portal reality verified 2026-07-11:** Next.js 16 (read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` —
AGENTS.md warning), pnpm gates (`test`/`lint`/`typecheck`/`build`), Postgres via `db:up` +
numbered SQL migrations (next: 0006), existing `src/app/(app)/trust-signals/page.tsx` scaffold
(WebAuthn + TOTP live since M8), `src/server/directory/` HTTP client, `src/server/trust/`,
`pnpm test:e2e:real-dir` for e2e against a real directory, `@cello-protocol/crypto` already a
dependency. No deploy pipeline — local/dev for this milestone.

**Prerequisites already landed (do not re-derive):** `agent_id` join-key migration shipped
(M8C Entry 87, daemon 0.0.45+); address-book schema live (v0.0.94); the M10 design docs carry
the resolved §14 gap list and the §15 zero-bump amendment.

**Next:** DOD-CBOR-1.
