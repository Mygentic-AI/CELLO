## Entries


### Entry 1: DOD-SCHEMA-P0-1 (Waitlist Foundation Schema)
**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Target:** DOD-SCHEMA-P0-1

**Clause Checklist:**
- [x] waitlist_users table + columns
- [x] waitlist_touchpoints table + columns
- [x] referral_codes table + columns + CHECK constraint (one_owner_or_creator)
- [x] referrals table + columns + UNIQUE on referred_user_id
- [x] email_jobs table + columns + template enum + status enum
- [x] auth_tokens table + columns
- [x] Idempotent creation (IF NOT EXISTS everywhere)
- [x] Fixed: 15-minute expiry constraint enforced at DB layer

**Evidence:**
- Created `migrations/0008_m11_waitlist_p0.sql` in `ops-dashboard` repository.
- Migrations utilize `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for pure idempotency.
- Subagent `cello-unit-reviewer` confirmed clauses except for missing 15-minute `expires_at` constraint on `auth_tokens`, which was subsequently corrected. Lens 4 Test Teeth was waived. 
- Due to the remote `mygentic-ai/ops-dashboard` repo not existing yet, the commit sits safely in the local branch ready for push.
