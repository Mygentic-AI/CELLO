# M12 Build Journal

## RESUME STATE (keep current — overwrite this block only)

- **Tier:** P0 — PROJECT-1 ✅, IAM-1 ✅ (reviewed, all findings fixed), CI-REGISTRY-1 🟠
  (registry + proven directory build; relay building; triggers blocked on GitHub OAuth),
  IAC-BASE-1 seeded (owes the disposable MIG up/down proof).
- **Next red:** DOD-IAC-BASE-1 while CI-REGISTRY-1 waits on the OAuth click.
- **Blocked on Andre:** complete the `cello-github` connection OAuth (link in Entry 3 / terminal).
- **HEAD:** trustless-cello `main` (see git log); cello-client untouched by M12 so far.
- **Cloud state:** AWS = 3 regions awake (woken 2026-07-28, see infra/STATE.md). GCP =
  `cello-infra` live (project + billing + 11 APIs + empty custom `cello-vpc`); authoritative
  record in `infra/GCP-STATE.md`, incl. the billing 5-slot ledger.
- **Parked:** M12-P1 (demo agent), M12-P2 (portal/waitlist DB coupling), M12-P3 (enrollment,
  out of scope), M12-P4 (replica nodes at launch).
- **Blocked on Andre:** nothing.

## Entry 0 — 2026-07-28 — Milestone scaffolded; pre-work evidence carried in

**What exists before any unit:**

- Spec-of-record committed: `2026-07-28_0700_gcp-rebuild-decision-record.md` (11 decisions +
  waves). Derivations in the superseded `2026-07-25_1034` log.
- **Live GCP recon (gcloud, 2026-07-28, account andre@mygentic.ai):**
  - Billing account `012EFA-590A2E-2A82B4` open; 5 projects linked; Andre holds `billing.admin`;
    `projectCreator` + `billing.creator` are domain-wide org grants → `cello-infra` creation and
    linking verified possible. Credits ~$23k to Nov 2027 (Andre) — GCP cost is never a factor.
  - Quotas per region (us-east1, us-central1, europe-west1, europe-west3, asia-northeast1):
    200 CPUs (24 E2), 8 static IPs, 4 TB disk, zero usage — no quota requests needed.
  - Org policies (org 376185218056): SA key creation AND upload disabled (enforced) → WIF only
    for cross-cloud auth; automatic IAM grants for default SAs disabled → every grant explicit,
    silent-403 failure mode; no external-IP ban; domain-member restriction allows all.
- **Live AWS evidence (2026-07-25, ECS Exec read-only):** 5 agents / 5 shares / 5 epochs in the
  us-east-1 directory DB — the rebuild-from-zero decision rests on this. Replication mesh healthy
  (2 slots active, lag ~1.1 KB). `directory_nodes` anomaly: only the self row present —
  diagnose during P1/P2, don't just observe its absence on the fresh system.
- **Milestone numbering (M12-D1):** this milestone took M12; former roadmap M12–M17 renumbered
  M13–M18 in `implementation-roadmap.md` + `ROADMAP.md`.

**Next:** DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1.

## Entry 1 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1: cello-infra live; the billing 5-slot cap is real

**The billing constraint Andre hit before is confirmed and now understood.** `gcloud billing
projects link cello-infra` failed with `FAILED_PRECONDITION: Cloud billing quota exceeded` — the
account caps at **5 linked projects**. My §8 claim in the superseded plan ("linking a sixth is
very likely fine") was **wrong**; Andre's lived experience was right. The fix took one command,
not days, because the cap is a *slot* limit, not a wall: unlink `claude-code-vertex-mygentic`
(empty — zero resources, verified) → slot freed → `cello-infra` linked successfully.
`billingEnabled: true` confirmed. Full slot ledger recorded in `infra/GCP-STATE.md`.

**Clause checklist:**
- Project created: `cello-infra`, number 955736313934, org 376185218056 ✓
- Billing linked (via slot swap) ✓
- APIs: exactly 11 enabled, list in GCP-STATE.md (compute, artifactregistry, cloudbuild,
  sqladmin, secretmanager, storage, logging, monitoring, cloudresourcemanager, iam,
  serviceusage). No Vertex surface, no servicenetworking (PSA stays out per DOD-INV-NO-VPN —
  note: Cloud SQL private-IP *inside* GCP uses PSA plumbing; whether the invariant permits
  intra-GCP PSA or we use the Cloud SQL connector/auth-proxy path instead is a design point for
  DOD-AE-DESIGN-1/DOD-NODE-DIR-GCP-1, journaled here so it is not discovered late) ✓
- Default network + its 4 default firewall rules deleted; custom-mode `cello-vpc` created,
  zero subnets (per-region subnets come with node IaC) ✓
- `infra/GCP-STATE.md` created and committed ✓

**Owed for ✅:** import project/APIs/VPC into Terraform at DOD-IAC-BASE-1 (bootstrap was raw
gcloud, which is acceptable only as the documented bootstrap layer).

**Next:** DOD-GCP-IAM-1.

---

## Entry 2 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-GCP-IAM-1 via Terraform (seeds DOD-IAC-BASE-1)

Terraform chosen per M12-D2; doing IAM through it lands both lines' groundwork at once.

- **State backend:** `gs://cello-infra-tfstate` (us-east1, versioned, UBLA) — bucket
  bootstrap-created then imported, so TF manages its own state home.
- **Adopted bootstrap:** 11 APIs as `google_project_service` (disable_on_destroy=false),
  `cello-vpc` imported, project as data source (the one permanent bootstrap-layer object).
- **DOD-GCP-IAM-1 clauses:** 5 per-workload SAs (`cello-directory-node`, `cello-relay-node`,
  `cello-ops-agent`, `cello-portal`, `cello-cloud-build`) + 17 project-level minimal bindings
  (secretAccessor / cloudsql.client / logWriter / metricWriter per workload; AR writer for CI).
  Default compute SA: attached to nothing, granted nothing. Tightening to resource-scoped
  bindings as resources appear is expected; WIDENING needs a journal entry.
- **Evidence:** `terraform apply` — 33 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed; follow-up
  `terraform plan` — **No changes** (live == code). SA list verified via gcloud.
- DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1's owed import → done → flipped ✅.

**Next:** unit review on the terraform diff, then DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1.

## Entry 3 — 2026-07-28 — IAM review findings fixed; first Cloud Build images; GitHub connection pending OAuth

**Unit review (cello-unit-reviewer, no model override) on DOD-GCP-IAM-1: SPEC FAITHFUL, 6
findings, ALL addressed:**
- **F1 (medium):** project-level `secretmanager.secretAccessor` on 4 workload SAs would let any
  workload read any other's key material once secrets exist, and no 403 would ever prompt
  tightening. **Fixed by removal** — secret access is now granted per-secret in the unit that
  creates each secret; a missing grant fails loud, which makes minimality self-enforcing.
- **F2 (medium):** CI's project-wide `storage.objectViewer` included the tfstate bucket (all
  historical state versions). **Fixed:** replaced with a bucket-scoped grant on the Cloud Build
  staging bucket only.
- **F3 (low):** additive `iam_member` means plan-clean ≠ no out-of-band grants. **Fixed:** caveat
  + audit command in GCP-STATE.md; audit at tier boundaries.
- **F4 (low):** tfstate bucket now `prevent_destroy` + `public_access_prevention=enforced`.
- **F5 (minor):** .gitignore covers tfvars/override/crash files.
- **F6 (note):** ops-agent has no `cloudsql.client` yet — intentional; its DB-access pattern is
  redesigned in DOD-MOVE-OPSAGENT-1 (no cross-cloud DB), so the grant is decided there.
Post-fix: apply clean, `terraform plan` No changes. IAM-1 → ✅.

**DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1 progress:**
- Artifact Registry `cello` (us-east1) via TF.
- **First CELLO image ever built on GCP:** `gcloud builds submit` (source → Cloud Build →
  Artifact Registry; no local docker) → `directory:manual-dedc55ac` **SUCCESS**, run as the
  `cello-cloud-build` SA. Relay build `dd2ba947` running.
- Silent-403 class hit twice in one hour, exactly as predicted (Entry 0): Cloud Build's P4SA had
  NO roles (org strips service-agent auto-grants). Fixed in TF: `cloudbuild.serviceAgent` +
  `secretmanager.admin` (the latter is the documented requirement for 2nd-gen GitHub
  connections — the P4SA creates/manages the OAuth-token secret).
- `cello-github` connection created, state **PENDING_USER_OAUTH** — Andre must open the
  authorization link (printed in terminal; also retrievable via
  `gcloud builds connections describe cello-github --region=us-east1`). Path-filtered triggers
  for `packages/directory/**` and `packages/relay/**` are the remaining clause.
- `.gcloudignore` added (keeps `gcloud builds submit` uploads to Dockerfile-relevant sources).

**Next:** DOD-IAC-BASE-1 (disposable MIG proof) while OAuth waits.

---

## Entry 4 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-IAC-BASE-1 enforcer green; relay image done

- **Relay image built by Cloud Build:** `relay:manual-50e06e3d` SUCCESS → Artifact Registry.
  Both node images now exist on GCP, built without a single local docker command.
- **Disposable probe (probe.tf, gated by `disposable_probe` var, default false):**
  - `apply -var disposable_probe=true` → 5 added: `cello-probe-r4c7` **RUNNING** in us-east1-b,
    static IP 34.26.220.192, COS-stable, e2-small, directory-node SA attached, IAP-only SSH
    firewall + the permanent `cello-us-east1` subnet (10.10.0.0/24).
  - `apply` (default false) → 4 destroyed; zero instances, zero addresses; plan **No changes**.
  - Known-and-recorded: the probe pins the static IP in the instance template — fine at size 1,
    deadlocks on rolling replace; the real node units use a stateful-IP MIG policy instead
    (stated in probe.tf's header so nobody copies the probe pattern).
- Unit review dispatched; findings land in Entry 5.

**Next:** fix review findings; triggers unit blocked on Andre's GitHub OAuth.
