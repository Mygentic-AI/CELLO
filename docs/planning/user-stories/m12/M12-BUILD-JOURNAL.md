# M12 Build Journal

## RESUME STATE (keep current — overwrite this block only)

- **Tier:** pre-P0 — milestone scaffolded, no unit started.
- **Next red:** DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1 (create `cello-infra`, link billing, enable APIs, GCP-STATE.md).
- **HEAD:** trustless-cello `main` (see git log); cello-client untouched by M12 so far.
- **Cloud state:** AWS = 3 regions awake (woken 2026-07-28, see infra/STATE.md). GCP = nothing
  exists yet; `cello-infra` not created; verified facts from 2026-07-28 recon are in Entry 0.
- **Parked:** M12-P1 (demo agent), M12-P2 (portal/waitlist DB coupling), M12-P3 (enrollment,
  out of scope), M12-P4 (replica nodes at launch).
- **Blocked on Andre:** nothing.

## Entry 0 — 2026-07-28 — Milestone scaffolded; pre-work evidence carried in

**What exists before any unit:**

- Spec-of-record committed: `2026-07-28_0700_gcp-rebuild-decision-record.md` (11 decisions +
  waves). Derivations in the superseded `2026-07-25_1034` log.
- **Live GCP recon (gcloud, 2026-07-28, account andre@mygentic.ai):**
  - Billing account `012EFA-590A2E-2A82B4` open; 5 projects linked; Andre holds `billing.admin`;
    `projectCreator` + `billing.creator` are domain-wide org grants → `cello-infra` creation and
    linking verified possible. Credits ~$23k to Nov 2027 (Andre) — GCP cost is never a factor.
  - Quotas per region (us-east1, us-central1, europe-west1, europe-west3, asia-northeast1):
    200 CPUs (24 E2), 8 static IPs, 4 TB disk, zero usage — no quota requests needed.
  - Org policies (org 376185218056): SA key creation AND upload disabled (enforced) → WIF only
    for cross-cloud auth; automatic IAM grants for default SAs disabled → every grant explicit,
    silent-403 failure mode; no external-IP ban; domain-member restriction allows all.
- **Live AWS evidence (2026-07-25, ECS Exec read-only):** 5 agents / 5 shares / 5 epochs in the
  us-east-1 directory DB — the rebuild-from-zero decision rests on this. Replication mesh healthy
  (2 slots active, lag ~1.1 KB). `directory_nodes` anomaly: only the self row present —
  diagnose during P1/P2, don't just observe its absence on the fresh system.
- **Milestone numbering (M12-D1):** this milestone took M12; former roadmap M12–M17 renumbered
  M13–M18 in `implementation-roadmap.md` + `ROADMAP.md`.

**Next:** DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1.
