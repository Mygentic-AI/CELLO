  Append-only audit trail and evidence home for M12 (multi-cloud rebuild). Full proofs, run
  output, and bug forensics live here, pointed to from M12-DEFINITION-OF-DONE. Never edit a
  prior entry. New file per tier (M12-BUILD-JOURNAL-T{n}.md) seeded with a resume block.

# M12 Build Journal

## RESUME STATE (keep current — overwrite this block only)

- **Tier:** P0 — PROJECT-1 ✅, IAM-1 🟡 (owes unit review), IAC-BASE-1 partially seeded
  (skeleton + imports live; owes the disposable MIG up/down proof).
- **Next red:** finish IAM-1 review, then DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1 (Artifact Registry + Cloud Build).
- **HEAD:** trustless-cello `main` (see git log); cello-client untouched by M12 so far.
- **Cloud state:** AWS = 3 regions awake (woken 2026-07-28, see infra/STATE.md). GCP =
  `cello-infra` live (project + billing + 11 APIs + empty custom `cello-vpc`); authoritative
  record in `infra/GCP-STATE.md`, incl. the billing 5-slot ledger.
- **Parked:** M12-P1 (demo agent), M12-P2 (portal/waitlist DB coupling), M12-P3 (enrollment,
  out of scope), M12-P4 (replica nodes at launch).
- **Blocked on Andre:** nothing.

## Entry 0 — 2026-07-28 — Milestone scaffolded; pre-work evidence carried in

**What exists before any unit:**

- Spec-of-record committed: `2026-07-28_0700_gcp-rebuild-decision-record.md` (11 decisions +
  waves). Derivations in the superseded `2026-07-25_1034` log.
- **Live GCP recon (gcloud, 2026-07-28, account andre@mygentic.ai):**
  - Billing account `012EFA-590A2E-2A82B4` open; 5 projects linked; Andre holds `billing.admin`;
    `projectCreator` + `billing.creator` are domain-wide org grants → `cello-infra` creation and
    linking verified possible. Credits ~$23k to Nov 2027 (Andre) — GCP cost is never a factor.
  - Quotas per region (us-east1, us-central1, europe-west1, europe-west3, asia-northeast1):
    200 CPUs (24 E2), 8 static IPs, 4 TB disk, zero usage — no quota requests needed.
  - Org policies (org 376185218056): SA key creation AND upload disabled (enforced) → WIF only
    for cross-cloud auth; automatic IAM grants for default SAs disabled → every grant explicit,
    silent-403 failure mode; no external-IP ban; domain-member restriction allows all.
- **Live AWS evidence (2026-07-25, ECS Exec read-only):** 5 agents / 5 shares / 5 epochs in the
  us-east-1 directory DB — the rebuild-from-zero decision rests on this. Replication mesh healthy
  (2 slots active, lag ~1.1 KB). `directory_nodes` anomaly: only the self row present —
  diagnose during P1/P2, don't just observe its absence on the fresh system.
- **Milestone numbering (M12-D1):** this milestone took M12; former roadmap M12–M17 renumbered
  M13–M18 in `implementation-roadmap.md` + `ROADMAP.md`.

**Next:** DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1.

## Entry 1 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1: cello-infra live; the billing 5-slot cap is real

**The billing constraint Andre hit before is confirmed and now understood.** `gcloud billing
projects link cello-infra` failed with `FAILED_PRECONDITION: Cloud billing quota exceeded` — the
account caps at **5 linked projects**. My §8 claim in the superseded plan ("linking a sixth is
very likely fine") was **wrong**; Andre's lived experience was right. The fix took one command,
not days, because the cap is a *slot* limit, not a wall: unlink `claude-code-vertex-mygentic`
(empty — zero resources, verified) → slot freed → `cello-infra` linked successfully.
`billingEnabled: true` confirmed. Full slot ledger recorded in `infra/GCP-STATE.md`.

**Clause checklist:**
- Project created: `cello-infra`, number 955736313934, org 376185218056 ✓
- Billing linked (via slot swap) ✓
- APIs: exactly 11 enabled, list in GCP-STATE.md (compute, artifactregistry, cloudbuild,
  sqladmin, secretmanager, storage, logging, monitoring, cloudresourcemanager, iam,
  serviceusage). No Vertex surface, no servicenetworking (PSA stays out per DOD-INV-NO-VPN —
  note: Cloud SQL private-IP *inside* GCP uses PSA plumbing; whether the invariant permits
  intra-GCP PSA or we use the Cloud SQL connector/auth-proxy path instead is a design point for
  DOD-AE-DESIGN-1/DOD-NODE-DIR-GCP-1, journaled here so it is not discovered late) ✓
- Default network + its 4 default firewall rules deleted; custom-mode `cello-vpc` created,
  zero subnets (per-region subnets come with node IaC) ✓
- `infra/GCP-STATE.md` created and committed ✓

**Owed for ✅:** import project/APIs/VPC into Terraform at DOD-IAC-BASE-1 (bootstrap was raw
gcloud, which is acceptable only as the documented bootstrap layer).

**Next:** DOD-GCP-IAM-1.

---

## Entry 2 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-GCP-IAM-1 via Terraform (seeds DOD-IAC-BASE-1)

Terraform chosen per M12-D2; doing IAM through it lands both lines' groundwork at once.

- **State backend:** `gs://cello-infra-tfstate` (us-east1, versioned, UBLA) — bucket
  bootstrap-created then imported, so TF manages its own state home.
- **Adopted bootstrap:** 11 APIs as `google_project_service` (disable_on_destroy=false),
  `cello-vpc` imported, project as data source (the one permanent bootstrap-layer object).
- **DOD-GCP-IAM-1 clauses:** 5 per-workload SAs (`cello-directory-node`, `cello-relay-node`,
  `cello-ops-agent`, `cello-portal`, `cello-cloud-build`) + 17 project-level minimal bindings
  (secretAccessor / cloudsql.client / logWriter / metricWriter per workload; AR writer for CI).
  Default compute SA: attached to nothing, granted nothing. Tightening to resource-scoped
  bindings as resources appear is expected; WIDENING needs a journal entry.
- **Evidence:** `terraform apply` — 33 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed; follow-up
  `terraform plan` — **No changes** (live == code). SA list verified via gcloud.
- DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1's owed import → done → flipped ✅.

**Next:** unit review on the terraform diff, then DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1.
