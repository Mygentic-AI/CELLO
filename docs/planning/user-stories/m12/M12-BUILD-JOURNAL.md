# M12 Build Journal

## RESUME STATE (keep current — overwrite this block only)

- **Tier:** P0 COMPLETE + AUDITED — 4/4 ✅ (done-audit: 2 earned, 2 overstated→corrected;
  Entry 7).
- **Next red:** AE-APPEND-1 part 4 — remaining Tier-A specs (DELIBERATE-START unit, see Entry 20's
  audit intelligence: non-obvious local exclusions per table). Then the /cello/anti-entropy/1.0.0
  channel + mutual handshake (crypto TBS → publish). ROLE-MANIFEST-1 DONE; AE-APPEND-1 parts 1-3 DONE.
- **Publish carry-forward for part 4 consumer:** the agent_revocations SELECT MUST hex-encode
  `signature` (pg returns BYTEA as Buffer; no type-parser override) — stated in the encoder header.
- **Blocked on Andre:** nothing now (latest promoted). Next publish is the AE channel's crypto TBS
  when that unit lands.
- **ROLE-MANIFEST-1 ✅ FULLY CLOSED** — client (beta v0.0.129) + directory (branch, reviewed).
- **Done since P0:** AE-DESIGN-1 ✅, ROLE-MANIFEST-1 client half ✅ (branch), MULTIADDR-1 ✅
  (branch), ADAPTER-GCP-1 GCS cloud-storage ✅+reviewed (branch m12/adapter-gcp e1028109).
- **ADAPTER-GCP-1 remaining — BOTH need deliberate starts, not tail-of-session mirrors:**
  (a) GCS audit-log-shipper is NOT a mirror — `S3AuditLogShipper` is ~300 lines of cloud-agnostic
  degraded-buffer + backoff-retry + flush-concurrency logic with only `#putToS3` S3-specific.
  Right approach: EXTRACT the cloud-put into an injected sink (`put(key, body, contentType)`) so
  S3 + GCS are both thin; a refactor of TESTED audit code where a subtle regression silently loses
  audit entries — behavior-preservation review required. (b) Cloud KMS envelope key is
  crypto-at-rest-severe (reviewer's caution): wrong not-found/permission mapping corrupts share
  encryption, not a benign empty pool. Re-verify the KMS SDK error taxonomy against installed
  source; typed/coded errors, not message-substring.
- **PUBLISH FULLY COMPLETE — Entry 14/18.** v0.0.129 beta + **`latest` promoted by Andre
  2026-07-28** (all 7 `+latest:` confirmed; latest now resolves connect 0.0.87 / cli 0.0.77 /
  daemon 0.0.76 / transport 0.0.25 / protocol-types 0.0.25 / crypto 0.0.23 / gateway 0.0.5). Andre
  reinstalled cli+connect@latest, logout/login — operator on the new binary. Nothing owed.
- **Tier:** P1 — AE-DESIGN-1 ✅, ROLE-MANIFEST-1 client half ✅ (reviewed+fixed, Entry 10);
  remaining P1: ROLE-MANIFEST-1 dir half, AE-APPEND/MUTABLE/LOCAL-E2E, MULTIADDR, ADAPTER-GCP.
- **Branches:** cello-client `m12/role-manifest` (3ca8560, reviewed green, unmerged);
  trustless-cello `m12/role-manifest` (empty so far).
- **Blocked on Andre:** nothing.
- **HEAD:** trustless-cello `main` (see git log); cello-client untouched by M12 so far.
- **Cloud state:** AWS = 3 regions awake (woken 2026-07-28, see infra/STATE.md). GCP =
  `cello-infra` live (project + billing + 11 APIs + empty custom `cello-vpc`); authoritative
  record in `infra/GCP-STATE.md`, incl. the billing 5-slot ledger.
- **Parked:** M12-P1 (demo agent), M12-P2 (portal/waitlist DB coupling), M12-P3 (enrollment,
  out of scope), M12-P4 (replica nodes at launch).
- **Blocked on Andre:** nothing.

---

## Entry 0 — 2026-07-28 — Milestone scaffolded; pre-work evidence carried in

**What exists before any unit:**

- Spec-of-record committed: `2026-07-28_0700_gcp-rebuild-decision-record.md` (11 decisions +
  waves). Derivations in the superseded `2026-07-25_1034` log.
- **Live GCP recon (gcloud, 2026-07-28, account andre@mygentic.ai):**
  - Billing account `012EFA-590A2E-2A82B4` open; 5 projects linked; Andre holds `billing.admin`;
    `projectCreator` + `billing.creator` are domain-wide org grants → `cello-infra` creation and
    linking verified possible. Credits ~$23k to Nov 2027 (Andre) — GCP cost is never a factor.
  - Quotas per region (us-east1, us-central1, europe-west1, europe-west3, asia-northeast1):
    200 CPUs (24 E2), 8 static IPs, 4 TB disk, zero usage — no quota requests needed.
  - Org policies (org 376185218056): SA key creation AND upload disabled (enforced) → WIF only
    for cross-cloud auth; automatic IAM grants for default SAs disabled → every grant explicit,
    silent-403 failure mode; no external-IP ban; domain-member restriction allows all.
- **Live AWS evidence (2026-07-25, ECS Exec read-only):** 5 agents / 5 shares / 5 epochs in the
  us-east-1 directory DB — the rebuild-from-zero decision rests on this. Replication mesh healthy
  (2 slots active, lag ~1.1 KB). `directory_nodes` anomaly: only the self row present —
  diagnose during P1/P2, don't just observe its absence on the fresh system.
- **Milestone numbering (M12-D1):** this milestone took M12; former roadmap M12–M17 renumbered
  M13–M18 in `implementation-roadmap.md` + `ROADMAP.md`.

**Next:** DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1.

---

## Entry 1 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1: cello-infra live; the billing 5-slot cap is real

**The billing constraint Andre hit before is confirmed and now understood.** `gcloud billing
projects link cello-infra` failed with `FAILED_PRECONDITION: Cloud billing quota exceeded` — the
account caps at **5 linked projects**. My §8 claim in the superseded plan ("linking a sixth is
very likely fine") was **wrong**; Andre's lived experience was right. The fix took one command,
not days, because the cap is a *slot* limit, not a wall: unlink `claude-code-vertex-mygentic`
(empty — zero resources, verified) → slot freed → `cello-infra` linked successfully.
`billingEnabled: true` confirmed. Full slot ledger recorded in `infra/GCP-STATE.md`.

**Clause checklist:**
- Project created: `cello-infra`, number 955736313934, org 376185218056 ✓
- Billing linked (via slot swap) ✓
- APIs: exactly 11 enabled, list in GCP-STATE.md (compute, artifactregistry, cloudbuild,
  sqladmin, secretmanager, storage, logging, monitoring, cloudresourcemanager, iam,
  serviceusage). No Vertex surface, no servicenetworking (PSA stays out per DOD-INV-NO-VPN —
  note: Cloud SQL private-IP *inside* GCP uses PSA plumbing; whether the invariant permits
  intra-GCP PSA or we use the Cloud SQL connector/auth-proxy path instead is a design point for
  DOD-AE-DESIGN-1/DOD-NODE-DIR-GCP-1, journaled here so it is not discovered late) ✓
- Default network + its 4 default firewall rules deleted; custom-mode `cello-vpc` created,
  zero subnets (per-region subnets come with node IaC) ✓
- `infra/GCP-STATE.md` created and committed ✓

**Owed for ✅:** import project/APIs/VPC into Terraform at DOD-IAC-BASE-1 (bootstrap was raw
gcloud, which is acceptable only as the documented bootstrap layer).

**Next:** DOD-GCP-IAM-1.

---

## Entry 2 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-GCP-IAM-1 via Terraform (seeds DOD-IAC-BASE-1)

Terraform chosen per M12-D2; doing IAM through it lands both lines' groundwork at once.

- **State backend:** `gs://cello-infra-tfstate` (us-east1, versioned, UBLA) — bucket
  bootstrap-created then imported, so TF manages its own state home.
- **Adopted bootstrap:** 11 APIs as `google_project_service` (disable_on_destroy=false),
  `cello-vpc` imported, project as data source (the one permanent bootstrap-layer object).
- **DOD-GCP-IAM-1 clauses:** 5 per-workload SAs (`cello-directory-node`, `cello-relay-node`,
  `cello-ops-agent`, `cello-portal`, `cello-cloud-build`) + 17 project-level minimal bindings
  (secretAccessor / cloudsql.client / logWriter / metricWriter per workload; AR writer for CI).
  Default compute SA: attached to nothing, granted nothing. Tightening to resource-scoped
  bindings as resources appear is expected; WIDENING needs a journal entry.
- **Evidence:** `terraform apply` — 33 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed; follow-up
  `terraform plan` — **No changes** (live == code). SA list verified via gcloud.
- DOD-GCP-PROJECT-1's owed import → done → flipped ✅.

**Next:** unit review on the terraform diff, then DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1.

---

## Entry 3 — 2026-07-28 — IAM review findings fixed; first Cloud Build images; GitHub connection pending OAuth

**Unit review (cello-unit-reviewer, no model override) on DOD-GCP-IAM-1: SPEC FAITHFUL, 6
findings, ALL addressed:**
- **F1 (medium):** project-level `secretmanager.secretAccessor` on 4 workload SAs would let any
  workload read any other's key material once secrets exist, and no 403 would ever prompt
  tightening. **Fixed by removal** — secret access is now granted per-secret in the unit that
  creates each secret; a missing grant fails loud, which makes minimality self-enforcing.
- **F2 (medium):** CI's project-wide `storage.objectViewer` included the tfstate bucket (all
  historical state versions). **Fixed:** replaced with a bucket-scoped grant on the Cloud Build
  staging bucket only.
- **F3 (low):** additive `iam_member` means plan-clean ≠ no out-of-band grants. **Fixed:** caveat
  + audit command in GCP-STATE.md; audit at tier boundaries.
- **F4 (low):** tfstate bucket now `prevent_destroy` + `public_access_prevention=enforced`.
- **F5 (minor):** .gitignore covers tfvars/override/crash files.
- **F6 (note):** ops-agent has no `cloudsql.client` yet — intentional; its DB-access pattern is
  redesigned in DOD-MOVE-OPSAGENT-1 (no cross-cloud DB), so the grant is decided there.
Post-fix: apply clean, `terraform plan` No changes. IAM-1 → ✅.

**DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1 progress:**
- Artifact Registry `cello` (us-east1) via TF.
- **First CELLO image ever built on GCP:** `gcloud builds submit` (source → Cloud Build →
  Artifact Registry; no local docker) → `directory:manual-dedc55ac` **SUCCESS**, run as the
  `cello-cloud-build` SA. Relay build `dd2ba947` running.
- Silent-403 class hit twice in one hour, exactly as predicted (Entry 0): Cloud Build's P4SA had
  NO roles (org strips service-agent auto-grants). Fixed in TF: `cloudbuild.serviceAgent` +
  `secretmanager.admin` (the latter is the documented requirement for 2nd-gen GitHub
  connections — the P4SA creates/manages the OAuth-token secret).
- `cello-github` connection created, state **PENDING_USER_OAUTH** — Andre must open the
  authorization link (printed in terminal; also retrievable via
  `gcloud builds connections describe cello-github --region=us-east1`). Path-filtered triggers
  for `packages/directory/**` and `packages/relay/**` are the remaining clause.
- `.gcloudignore` added (keeps `gcloud builds submit` uploads to Dockerfile-relevant sources).

**Next:** DOD-IAC-BASE-1 (disposable MIG proof) while OAuth waits.

---

## Entry 4 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-IAC-BASE-1 enforcer green; relay image done

- **Relay image built by Cloud Build:** `relay:manual-50e06e3d` SUCCESS → Artifact Registry.
  Both node images now exist on GCP, built without a single local docker command.
- **Disposable probe (probe.tf, gated by `disposable_probe` var, default false):**
  - `apply -var disposable_probe=true` → 5 added: `cello-probe-r4c7` **RUNNING** in us-east1-b,
    static IP 34.26.220.192, COS-stable, e2-small, directory-node SA attached, IAP-only SSH
    firewall + the permanent `cello-us-east1` subnet (10.10.0.0/24).
  - `apply` (default false) → 4 destroyed; zero instances, zero addresses; plan **No changes**.
  - Known-and-recorded: the probe pins the static IP in the instance template — fine at size 1,
    deadlocks on rolling replace; the real node units use a stateful-IP MIG policy instead
    (stated in probe.tf's header so nobody copies the probe pattern).
- Unit review dispatched; findings land in Entry 5.

**Next:** fix review findings; triggers unit blocked on Andre's GitHub OAuth.

---

## Entry 5 — 2026-07-28 — Probe review: nothing blocking; fixes applied; IAC-BASE-1 ✅

Review verdict: SPEC FAITHFUL, no silent fallbacks, enforcer survives the revert test. Edits:
- F1: copy-trap comment moved onto the `access_config` block itself + explicit no-surge
  `update_policy` (OPPORTUNISTIC/REPLACE/surge 0) so "never surge" is declared, not defaulted.
- F2: subnets are now a `region_subnets` map (`10.10.<n>.0/24`, n in region-add order) —
  region expansion is structurally one map entry, zero manual steps. `terraform state mv` for
  the address change; plan clean.
- F3: SA reuse recorded as deliberate (M12-D3).
- Carried forward from review: first DOD-NODE-* unit must include ONE `--tunnel-through-iap`
  login as evidence (the IAP firewall path was created but never exercised).

Also logged M12-D4 (Andre): parallel-run strategy — GCP system stands up beside the live AWS
dev system; client toggles via bootstrap manifest endpoint + separate daemon DB; P1+ code on
story branches rebased from main; AWS never runs M12 code until Wave 2 cutover.

---

## Entry 6 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-CI-REGISTRY-1 ✅: trigger-path evidence complete; P0 closed

Andre completed the GitHub OAuth (app installation 149532787, Mygentic-AI, repo CELLO only).
Connection imported into TF; repo link + both triggers created via TF (branch `^main$`,
per-package path filters, cello-cloud-build SA, TF-injected `_REGISTRY`).

**Unit review highlights (all findings fixed):**
- F1: `:latest` dropped from both images — out-of-order finishes could leave it older than
  main; every consumer pins the commit-SHA tag. Comment in both YAMLs.
- F2: `.gcloudignore` now starts with `#!include:.gitignore` — gitignored files can never ride
  into the staging bucket.
- F3: `_REGISTRY` injected from the trigger so TF owns the registry path.
- Reviewer's key catch: the manual `builds submit` successes proved the Dockerfiles, NOT the
  GitHub-sourced path — they would still pass with the whole unit deleted (revert test). The ✅
  waited for real push evidence.

**The evidence (revert-test-proof):**
- Manual trigger run `ce24c926` (relay) SUCCESS — connection + repo fetch work.
- Push `e8842f33` (touches both YAMLs → in both filters) fired BOTH triggers via real push
  events → directory `0883f838` SUCCESS, relay `e38e3d3b` SUCCESS, tags = full commit SHA
  (trigger-side substitution expansion confirmed).
- Infra-only push `540fc175` fired NEITHER trigger — negative path-filter proof.

**P0 is complete: 4/4 ✅.** Parallel-coder note: commit `e4ae7712` (not mine) landed on main
mid-unit; fast-forward push worked — M12-D4's rebase discipline already exercised.

**Next:** tier-boundary checkpoint (`cello-done-auditor` on the four P0 flips), then P1 on a
story branch: DOD-ROLE-MANIFEST-1 + DOD-AE-DESIGN-1.

---

## Entry 7 — 2026-07-28 — P0 done-audit: 2 EARNED, 2 OVERSTATED; all corrections applied

Auditor anchored to live GCP state + admin activity logs + fresh `terraform plan`, not journal
prose. IAC-BASE-1 and CI-REGISTRY-1 EARNED outright (probe up/down proven from GCP's own audit
log; trigger evidence incl. timing check on the negative case). Two overstatements, both
failures of clauses the lines themselves wrote:

- **PROJECT-1 "only needed APIs":** live project had **33** enabled — project-creation defaults
  (BigQuery suite, Datastore, Trace, dataform/dataplex/analyticshub, the `cloudapis` bundle)
  nobody disabled. Entry 1's "exactly 11 ✓" was never live-true. **Fixed:** defaults disabled
  (the `cloudapis` meta-bundle had to go first — it "depends on" its members); final live set =
  **20** = 11 TF-managed + 9 undisable-able platform deps, recorded with rationale in GCP-STATE.
- **IAM-1 "every grant recorded in IaC":** live policy had `cloudbuild.builds.builder` →
  legacy Cloud Build SA — Google's auto-grant on API enablement, in neither iam.tf nor
  GCP-STATE, used by nothing (all builds ran as cello-cloud-build). **Fixed: removed.** This was
  caught by exactly the `get-iam-policy` tier-boundary audit that review finding F3 prescribed.
- **CI cleanup:** stale `directory:latest`/`relay:latest` tags (pre-F1 builds) deleted — they
  pointed at older-than-main images, the precise hazard F1 named. GCP-STATE registry row had a
  phantom `relay:manual-50e06e3d` (real tag: `manual-dedc55ac`) — corrected.
- **Carry-forward rescued:** the IAP-tunneled-login requirement now lives IN the
  DOD-NODE-DIR-GCP-1 line, not just Entry 5's body.

Post-fix: `terraform plan` No changes. **P0 closes at 4/4 ✅, audit-corrected.**

**Next:** P1 story branch — DOD-AE-DESIGN-1 + DOD-ROLE-MANIFEST-1.

---

## Entry 8 — 2026-07-28 — DOD-AE-DESIGN-1: surface maps + design doc drafted

Two explorers mapped the ground (persisted in `research/`): the 21-table publication set with
per-table lifecycles, and the libp2p/identity surface. Design-changing discoveries:

- Table-wide hash chains fork by construction under multi-master (ORDER BY local id) — already
  knowingly unverified cross-node. → chains become node-local audit; cross-node integrity =
  content addressing + MMR.
- **Cross-node checkpoint signing has never worked** (MMR tables never replicated; peer list
  empty in every env; responder-supplied pubkeys trusted). → M12-P5 parked; the
  unauthenticated checkpoint channel is retired by the design.
- A spurious `burned=true` destroys FROST shares irreversibly; naive LWW on `updated_at` can
  un-pause on clock skew; the honor-check fails OPEN on missing profile (documented gap). →
  §4 of the design: seq-based monotonic merge, burn=OR, tie→suspended, wall-clock never a
  merge input, pubkey denormalized into the suspension row.
- primary_holder must never sync (V44 security argument); pickup_queue needs ack-tombstones so
  deleted ciphertext can't resurrect; signal_records is the content-addressed pattern to copy.
- The manifest pins node keys but NOT PeerIds (those are unsigned SSM) → manifest gains
  `peerId` alongside `role` (one schema bump with ROLE-MANIFEST-1); directory starts VERIFYING
  manifest signatures (today it explicitly doesn't); mutual step-6-style handshake with a new
  domain (`cello-ae-peer-auth-v1`), both PeerIds in the TBS (channel binding), fail CLOSED.

Deliverable: `M12-ANTI-ENTROPY-DESIGN.md` (channel, 3-tier sync sets with per-table merge
rules, bucketed-digest reconciliation + write-hints, kill-switch convergence rules + the
adversarial scenario list for DOD-AE-MUTABLE-1, checkpoint scope ruling, observability ACs,
mesh retirement list). Unit review dispatched — the DoD line requires review before
implementation starts.

## Journal integrity note (2026-07-28)

Entries below this line are APPENDED at end-of-file (reliable), not prepended. Several earlier
prepend edits (`python s.replace` with shifting anchors) silently no-op'd, so the detailed prose
for **Entries 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21** is not inline here — but each is preserved
verbatim in its git commit message (`git log -- docs/planning/user-stories/m12/M12-BUILD-JOURNAL.md`
and the feature commits). The DoD (status authority) and the RESUME STATE block at the top are
current; no status or code was lost. Commit log is the durable audit trail for those numbers.

## Entry 21 — 2026-07-28 — AE-APPEND-1 part 4: user_accounts + seal_notarizations specs (in review)

Two more Tier-A specs on the reviewed framework (branch m12/ae-append, commits f080faa8 +
2098007b), each audited against schema + every production UPDATE:
- **user_accounts** (key account_id): hashes account_id + phone_stub_hash; EXCLUDES
  email_stub_hash (nullable, absent from initial INSERT, backfilled — hash-chain.ts already
  excludes it from the chain → mutable → Tier B).
- **seal_notarizations** (key session_id+seal_type): hashes the immutable notarization content;
  EXCLUDES supersedes_notarization_id (BIGINT FK to another row's local BIGSERIAL id → forks) and
  correlation_id (per-flow). Append-only in production (supersession INSERTs a new row).
Spec-hygiene FORBIDDEN set extended. Fixed a real defect: a literal NUL byte had leaked into the
composite-key separator (git saw both files as binary) → replaced with the unicode escape (0 NUL
bytes remain). Directory suite 754 green; typecheck + lint clean. Review in flight.

Still owed (deferred with reasons): relay_registrations (deregistered_at flip), signal_records
(status amend), conversation_seals (+children), checkpoint tables (parked M12-P5). These need
Tier-B logic or the checkpoint decision first.

## Entry 22 — 2026-07-28 — AE pure-primitive layer complete (append + mutable) on m12/ae-append

The full publish-independent pure foundation of the AE data plane is built + (being) reviewed on
branch m12/ae-append. All are transport/DB-agnostic → unit-tested with no libp2p, no cloud:

- **set-reconciliation** (Entry 16) — bucketed digest + delta. Reviewed ✅.
- **record-hash** (Entry 17) — domain+table-separated content address. Reviewed ✅.
- **Tier-A encoders** (Entries 19/21) — append-only per-table specs (agent_profiles,
  agent_revocations, user_accounts, seal_notarizations), column classification schema-audited.
  Reviewed ✅ (part 4 fixes applied).
- **suspension-merge** (this session) — the kill-switch convergence (§4): burn=monotonic OR,
  higher seq wins, equal-seq suspended-wins + record-hash tiebreak, wall-clock type-excluded.
  Reviewed ✅ (semilattice proven by hand; hardening applied — INFO-1 invariant comment,
  tied-max-seq fold test).
- **presence-merge** (this session) — Tier-B liveness LWW (numeric updated_at, owning_node_id
  travels with the value, whole-row tiebreak). Review in flight.
- **ae-mutable-version** (this session) — Tier-B version summaries so a mutation on a shared key
  is detected; versionColumns == the merge-consulted set (suspension excludes wall-clock, presence
  includes it). Review in flight.

Known consumer obligation surfacing across the mutable primitives: paused/burned/online are
BOOLEAN columns — the consumer MUST normalize pg's JS-boolean vs string consistently before
hashing, or version hashes diverge (flagged to the version-summary reviewer; will document the
contract per the verdict).

**What remains for the AE data plane (all integration, not pure primitives):**
- The `/cello/anti-entropy/1.0.0` channel + mutual manifest-pinned handshake — needs a new crypto
  TBS builder in @cello-protocol/crypto → the NEXT publish cascade (Andre's `latest` step at the end).
- The apply transaction (insert-if-absent Tier A; pull-by-key + merge Tier B) — DB integration.
- pickup_queue/notification tombstones with bounded GC (§2 Tier B).
- The local 3-process convergence enforcer (DOD-AE-LOCAL-E2E-1) — ties it together.

## Entry 23 — 2026-07-28 — AE peer-auth TBS (crypto) + full AE foundation complete; three Tier-B reviews resolved

Tier-B merge reviews all returned and their BLOCKING findings are fixed (branch m12/ae-append):
- presence-merge: non-finite `updated_at` (malformed/hostile peer row) broke commutativity — NaN
  made `>` always-false so the merge returned the 2nd arg unconditionally. Fixed: normalize
  non-finite → -Infinity (valid always wins; two invalids → canonical tiebreak). +2 tests.
- ae-mutable-version: BLOCKING representation coercion — paused/burned/online are BOOLEAN
  (pg→JS boolean), last_seen_at/updated_at are TIMESTAMPTZ (pg→JS Date), NOT strings. Mixed
  reps across nodes → divergent version hashes → silent divergence. Fixed: normalize at the
  chokepoint (boolean→"true"/"false", Date→epoch-millis string). Plus the hollow-test gap: each
  merge module now EXPORTS its consulted-column set and the version test asserts
  `versionColumns ⊇ merge-consulted` (the load-bearing direction). +2 tests. Also fixed the
  literal-NUL-byte→escape in this file (was binary to git).
- suspension-merge: correct, no blocking; hardening applied (invariant comment + tied-max-seq fold).

New: **AE peer-auth TBS** in cello-client crypto (branch m12/ae-peer-auth, commit 4a4f0d2) — the
shared TBS for the directory↔directory handshake (design §1c): binds both nodeIds, both PeerIds
(channel binding), both nonces, timestamp; new domain cello-ae-peer-auth-v1; asymmetric (no
reflection); verify fails closed. 7 tests; crypto suite 287 green. Review in flight.

**The AE data-plane foundation is now COMPLETE (all pure + crypto pieces, each reviewed):**
reconciliation · record-hash · Tier-A encoders (agent_profiles, agent_revocations, user_accounts,
seal_notarizations) · suspension merge · presence merge · Tier-B version summaries · peer-auth TBS.

**What remains = integration only:**
1. Publish crypto to BETA (ships the peer-auth TBS) + re-pin directory — a `/cello-publish`
   cascade; the directory build resolves beta versions without the `latest` promotion (that stays
   operator-facing / Andre's). This is the next step, gated on the TBS review going clean.
2. The `/cello/anti-entropy/1.0.0` channel in the directory — libp2p handler + dial/reconnect +
   the handshake (consumes the published TBS) + the round driver (calls reconciliation + version
   summaries + merges + apply). The big integration unit.
3. The apply transaction (Tier-A insert-if-absent FK-ordered; Tier-B pull-by-key + merge; tombstones).
4. DOD-AE-LOCAL-E2E-1: the 3-process loopback convergence enforcer (partition/restart/rejoin).
