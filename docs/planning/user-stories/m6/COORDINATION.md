# M6 Agent Coordination Log

This file is the coordination point for all agents working on M6 stories. Because Claude Code has no fan-in mechanism, agents cannot see each other's work directly. Each agent appends an entry here when they have a dependency on another agent, a blocker, or completed work that others need to know about.

**Format for each entry:**
- Date/time at the top (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC)
- Agent/story identity
- What is blocked or waiting, and why
- What has already been done that is relevant to the blocker
- What the other agent needs to do (if known)

Read this file at the start of every session. Append, never overwrite.

This table is populated when OPS-AGENT-000 closes.
