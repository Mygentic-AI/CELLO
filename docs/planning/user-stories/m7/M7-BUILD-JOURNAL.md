  Append-only build journal for the M7 rebuild/repair phase (post-collapse). One
  entry per unit of work. NEVER edit a prior entry. This is the live-state +
  audit-trail follow-through doc: a fresh context reads the last few entries to
  resume. Pairs with M7-DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md (the target) and M7-PROCEDURE.md
  (the runbook). See M7-PROCEDURE.md §0 for read order and §1 for what each entry
  must contain.

# M7 Build Journal (append-only)

> Newest entries at the BOTTOM. Never edit or delete a prior entry. Each entry:
> DoD-ID, what was red, what was found, commit hashes, reviewer outcome, blockers,
> decisions. (M7-PROCEDURE.md §1, §8.)

## 2026-06-18 — Rebuild-phase kickoff (planning complete; no code yet)

**State.** M7 collapsed to one ground truth in `main` (both repos) earlier today
(see PRUNE-LEDGER.md, M7-STATE-OF-THE-UNION.md). The formal per-story process had
been abandoned during the collapse. This phase restarts disciplined work against a
consolidated target.

**Decision (Andre, 2026-06-18): NOT a from-scratch rewrite of the daemon client.**
Keep the daemon/client code that exists — it's the right architecture and most is
once-reviewed (DAEMON-001/002/003/004, Keystone, Registration; daemon 342 tests;
seams 1a–4 proven in-process). DELETE the dead `core/client` in-process stack.
Repair and VERIFY the existing daemon under a live binary test, vanilla-spine-first,
salvaging hard and reimplementing only what's genuinely broken / unverified /
dead-stack-homed (MSG-001-3b, SESSION-002, SESSION-004 client, SESSION-003 ABSENT
gate). Method differs from from-scratch; the target (the DoD) is the same either way.

**Produced this session (committed, docs-only):**
- `M7-DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md` — the consolidated target. Every M7 requirement pulled
  from all five sources (outline + E2E-001, the four postmortem stories, POSTMORTEM
  Parts 3–4, the April-8/May-14 logs, the security audit), ordered, status-tagged,
  mapped to 8 test journeys (J-SPINE → J-UPGRADE).
- `M7-PROCEDURE.md` — the runbook (three artifacts, the red-driven per-unit loop,
  commit/review/test/checkpoint cadence, hard rules, greenfield handling).
- `M7-BUILD-JOURNAL.md` — this file.

**Next red (the first unit of actual work).** Write **J-SPINE** as a live binary
test (M7-PROCEDURE.md §4): spawn the real directory + relay + daemon(s) on
localhost (NO AWS/deploy), drive `cello register` → `cello_initiate_session` →
`cello_await_session` → `cello_send` → `cello_receive` → `cello_close_session`,
assert DOD-SPINE-1..7. It will be almost entirely red — that's the map. Anchor to
the BINARY, not the library (never import `createClient`).

**Open decisions blocking nothing yet but needed soon (flagged in the DoD):**
1. **DOD-INV-4** — verify whether the sender = counterparty check is actually fixed
   in the daemon receive path or still broken as the 2026-06-11 audit found.
2. **Tier 5** — keep or retire the signed relay ACK (DOD-REC-1) and pre-seal
   reconciliation (DOD-REC-2); they may be superseded by MSG-001's ACK model.
3. **Tier 4** — write `DOD-UP-1/2` (bilateral upgrade, auto-ack) as real stories now,
   or explicitly park to a named future milestone (don't silently defer — RC-1).

**Branch / where work happens.** Code work goes on the assembly branch
(`CELLO-M7-MSG-001-REHOME` in cello-client, per M7-INTEGRATION-HANDOFF.md §1) or
`main` once Andre merges it. These planning docs are committed to `main`
(trustless-cello). NOTHING merged to main-code / NOTHING pushed without Andre.

**Reviewer outcome / blockers.** N/A (docs only this entry). No code, no tests run.
