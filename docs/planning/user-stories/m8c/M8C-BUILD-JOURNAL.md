  Append-only audit trail + live status board for M8C (command surface, notifications, reactive

# M8C — Build Journal

## Status board (update in place)

| Tier | Lines | Status |
|---|---|---|
| I — Invariants | INV-CONTENTFREE, INV-GATEWAY, INV-PUSHPULL, INV-HONEST-STATES, INV-ONE-PRIMARY | ❌ all |
| 0 — Prerequisites | SPIKE-1, M9INT-1 | ❌ ❌ |
| 1 — LAUNCH GATE | WAKE-1, AUTOSTART-1, INBOX-1, LIVE-1 | ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌ |
| 2 — Reactivity + surface | MSGWAKE-1, SINCESEQ-1, LOGINSTART-1, CONFIG-1, CURSOR-1 | ❌ all |
| 3 — Reachability | AWAY-1, CONTACT-1, ABUSE-1, TTL-1, TGDOOR-1 | ❌ all |
| 4 — Async foundation | RELAYWAKE-1, LEAVEMSG-1 | ❌ ❌ |
| 5 — Multi-daemon | PRIMARY-DESIGN-1, PRIMARY-1, POLICY-1, PORTAB-1 | ❌ all |

**Next unit:** DOD-SPIKE-1 — the ~30-min live `claude --channels` spike. The very first action.

**Resume pointer:** read M8C-PROCEDURE §0 read order, then take DOD-SPIKE-1. No code exists yet;
the milestone is greenfield except everything the verification pass proved already live
(daemon dispatch, IPC frames, M9 gateway on `m9-build`, the on-disk Telegram reference).

## Entries (append-only)

### 2026-07-05 — Entry 0: milestone seeded (verification pass + scope settled + apparatus)

**What happened.** The M8C raw notes were hardened into a milestone: every load-bearing
"already built / nearly free / transfers verbatim" claim was verified in code (verdict table +
evidence in [[M8C-MILESTONE-NOTES]] §Verification pass), scope/tiering was settled with Andre in
one batched ask, and the 5-doc apparatus was created.

**Verification highlights (all claims held; sharpened where noted):**
- Stage 1 nearly-free: CONFIRMED — shim drops frames at `ipc-proxy.ts:183-185`; daemon already
  dispatches on inbound sessions (`daemon.ts:3183`, drifted from `:3075` — cite symbols in
  stories); zero daemon change accurate.
- M9 merge: CONFIRMED + sharpened — merge dry-run **zero textual conflicts** (main +136 commits
  since divergence; m9-build +6,438 lines, self-contained `core/gateway`); semantic gate owed
  (all M8B-era content paths through the gateway) → baked into DOD-M9INT-1.
- Telegram plugin: CONFIRMED — 1,038 lines on disk; single-`getUpdates`-consumer constraint
  verbatim in its code → decided OQ-1 (daemon-owned).
- `since_seq`: zero hits (real work). Capability negotiation: absent (`clientType` only).
  `pickup_queue`: exists (V34/V35); ask-on-reconnect missing.
- New findings folded into the notes + DoD: pushes are fire-and-forget → INBOX is the
  loss-reconciler (elevated to Tier 1); double-wake with two attended sessions (→ CURSOR;
  launch shape = one attended session per agent); kill switch is portal's, tracked outside M8C;
  daemon-owned bot = new egress surface; Primary/Standby device-linking needs its own design log
  (→ DOD-PRIMARY-DESIGN-1 gate).

**Scope decisions (Andre, 2026-07-05 — full rationale in [[M8C-DECISIONS]]):**
D1 launch tier = doorbell only (spike → stage 1 → auto-start → INBOX); D2 Telegram Mode 1
doorbell in M8C, full-monitoring + Mode 2 → follow-on milestone; D3 async foundation AND
multi-daemon STAY in M8C as Tiers 4/5 (one big milestone, launch gates at end of Tier 1);
D4 OQ-1 closed — daemon-owned bot.

**Commits:** `c930783d` (verification pass into notes), `8aa53878` (wikilinks), this apparatus.

**Next:** DOD-SPIKE-1.
